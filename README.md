### Web scrapping for financial information

This project was used to experiment bringing in different kinds of information related to NYSE and NASDAQ stocks. Information is scrapped from Finviz, Zacks, and Yahoo Finance, and filters are applied depending on user interest. Information relates to news, financial metrics, and analyst ratings, and it is combined into a .csv. There is basic monitoring functionality for price alerts and experimentation for sending the alerts to email.
